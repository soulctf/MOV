## Polynomial Ring Definition 

The polynoial ring $R[x]$ is the set of formal sums $a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \dots+ a_{1}x+ a_0$  with $n \ge 0$ and $a_{i} \in R$. If $a_{n}\neq 0$, then the degree of the polynomail is n.

Addition and multiplication in this ringe works like traditional polynomials, just with coefficients in $R$.

## Properties

Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then
