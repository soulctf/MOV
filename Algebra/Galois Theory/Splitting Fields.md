Let $f$ be a polynomial with coefficients in $F$. A field $E$ containing $F$ is said to **split** $f$ if $f$ splits in $E[X]$, i.e., $$f(x) = a \prod_{i=1}^{m}(X-\alpha_{i}) \quad a \in F, \alpha_{i}\in E$$ If $E$ splits $f$, and is generated by the roots of $f$, then it is called a **splitting** or **root field** for $f$.

--- 
**Proposition 1:** Let $F(\alpha)$ be a simple extension of $F$ and $\Omega$ a second extension of $F$
1. Suppose $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$. For every $F$-homomoprhism $\phi : F(\alpha) \rightarrow \Omega$, $\phi(\alpha)$ is transcendental over $F$ and the map $\phi \mapsto \phi(\alpha)$ defines a one-to-one correspondence.
2. Suppose $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$
 
**Proposition 2:** Every polynomial $f \in F[X]$ has a splitting field $E_f$, and $$|E_{f}: F| \leq (deg \ f)!$$
