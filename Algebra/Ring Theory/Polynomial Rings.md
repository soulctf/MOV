## Polynomial Ring Definition 

The polynoial [[Rings|ring]] $R[x]$ is the set of formal sums $a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \dots+ a_{1}x+ a_0$  with $n \ge 0$ and $a_{i} \in R$. If $a_{n}\neq 0$, then the degree of the polynomail is n.

Addition and multiplication in this ringe works like traditional polynomials, just with coefficients in $R$.

## Properties

Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then
1. degree $p(x)q(x)$ = degree $p(x)$ + degree $q(x)$ if $p(x), q(x)$ are nonzero
2. The units of $R[x]$ are just the units of $R$
3. $R[x]$ is an integral domain

Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$, and let $(I) = I[x]$ denote the ideal of $R[x]$ generated by $I$ (the set of polynomails with coefficients in $I$). Then $$R[x] / (I) \cong (R / I)[x] $$ In particular, if $I$ is a prime ideal of $R$, then $(I)$ is a prime ideal of $R[x]$

If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a P.I.D and a U.F.D

## Factoring Polynomials

**Proposition 1:** Let $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ be a root of the polynomial $a_{m}X^{m} + a_{m-1}X^{m-1} ... + a_{1}X + a_0$ , and write $r = c/d$, then $c \mid a_0$ and $d \mid a_m$ 

Proof: Plugging in r to the polynomial and then multiplying by $d^m$ we get the following $$a_{m}c^{m}+ a_{m-1}c^{m-1}d+ ... + a_{0}d^{m}=0$$ which implies that $d \mid a_{m}c^{m}$ and $c \mid a_{0}$

**Proposition 2 (Gauss's Lemma):** Let $f(X) \in Z[X]$. If $f(X)$ factors nontrivally in $\mathbb[X]$, then it factors nontrivally in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$

**Proposition 3:** If $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$  is monic, then every monic factor of $f$ in $Q[X]$ lies in $Z[X]$.

**Proposition 4 (Eisenstein's Criterion):** Let $f = a_{m}X^{m} + a_{m-1}X^{m-1} ... + a_{1}X + a_0$, $a_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$. Suppose that there is a prime number $p$ such that:
1.  $p$ does not divide $a_m$
2.  $p$ divides $a_{m-1}, ... , a_0$ 
3. $p^{2}$ does not divide $a_0$
Then $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$.
