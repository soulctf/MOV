## Ring Definition

A **ring** is a set $R$ with two binary operations, $+$ (addition) and $\ast$ (multiplication), satisfying the following three axioms

1. $R$ is an abelien group under addition.
2. Multiplication is associative
3. Multiplication is distributive (left and right distriutive

If multiplication commutes for all elements in $R$, we call $R$ a commutative ring.

If there is an identity element under multiplication, we call $R$ a unital ring.
