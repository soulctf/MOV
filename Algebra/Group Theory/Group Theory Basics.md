## Group Definiton

A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\star$ that combines any two elements $a, b \in G$ to form a new element $a \star b \in G$, such that the following axioms hold.

Associativity: $$\text{For all } a, b, c \in G, \space (a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$$
Identity Element: $$\exists e \in G, \space \text{}$$
