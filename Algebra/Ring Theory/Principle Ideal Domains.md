## Principle Ideal Defintion

A principle ideal (P.I.D) is an integral domain in which every ideal is principle.

Note that [[#All Euclidean Domains are Principle Ideal Domains Principle Domains]], but not all Principle Ideal Domains are Euclidean Domains.
	Take the quadratic integer ring $\mathbb{Z}[(1 + \sqrt{19})/2]$ is not a Euclidean Domain but is a P.I.D

**Proposition 1:** Let $R$ be a P.I.D and let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero elements of $R$. Let $d$ be a generator of the principle ideal generated by $a$ and $b$. Then 
1. $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$
2. $d$ can be written as an $R$-*linear combination* of $a$ and $b$, i.e., these are elements $x, y \in R$ with $$d = ax + by$$
3. $d$ is unique up to multiplication by a unit in $R$
