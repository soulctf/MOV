Let $\mathbb{A}^n$ be the affine space of $R[x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots , x_n]$ 

If $f \in R[x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots , x_n]$, let $Z(f)$ be the set of points in $\mathbb{A}^n$ where $f$ vanishes.

Define the ***affine algebraic set*** $Z(S)$ to be the set of points that vanish on the polynomials in the set $S = \{f_{1}, f_{2}, \dots \}$ 
- If $f \in R[x, y] \backslash R$  (non-constant), $Z(f)$ is called the ***affine plane curve*** (2D curve, can be drawn on a plane)
- If $f \in R[x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots x_{n]} \backslash R$, $Z(f)$ is called a hyperplane

**Lemma:** Every affine algebraic set $Z(I)$ is the zero set for $I \subset R[x_{1}, \dots x_n]$  an ideal.
1. Consider $S, T \subset R[x_{1}, \dots x_{n}]$. If $S \subset T \implies Z(S) \supset Z(T)$, ($S$, $T$, subsets here)
2. As every element in $(S)$ is generated by linear combinations of polynomials in $S$, $Z(S) = Z((S))$.

### Zariski Topology

We want to define a topology over our affine algebraic sets for convenient language.

Affine algebraic sets are the closed subsets of a topology on $\mathbb{A}^n$.
- If we have a family of subsets $\{S_{\alpha}\} \subset R[x_{1}, \dots, x_n]$, then $\cap_{\alpha}Z(S_{\alpha})= Z(\cup_{\alpha}S_\alpha)$    
- $S, T \subset R[x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}] \implies Z(S) \cup Z(T) = Z(S * T)$ where $S*T = \{f*g \mid f \in S, g \in T\}$ 
Arbitrary intersection and finite union of affine algebraic sets are affine algebraic sets.

The empty set and $R[x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}]$ are open as they are the complement of
