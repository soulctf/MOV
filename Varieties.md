Let $\mathbb{A}^n$ be the affine space of $R[x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots , x_n]$ 

If $f \in R[x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots , x_n]$, let $Z(f)$ be the set of points in $\mathbb{A}^n$ where $f$ vanishes.

Define the ***affine algebraic set*** $Z(S)$ to be the set of points that vanish on the polynomials in the set $S = \{f_{1}, f_{2}, \dots \}$ 

If $f \in R[x, y] \backslash R$  (non-constant), $Z(f)$ is called the ***affine plane curve*** (2D curve, can be drawn on a plane)

If $f \in R[x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots x_{n]} \backslash R$, $Z(f)$ is called a hyperplane
