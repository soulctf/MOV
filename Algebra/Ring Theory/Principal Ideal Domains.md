## Principal Ideal Definition

A principal ideal (P.I.D) is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.

Note that [[Euclidean Domains#All Euclidean Domains are principal Ideal Domains principal Domains|All Euclidean Domains are principal Ideal Domains]], but not all principal Ideal Domains are Euclidean Domains.
	Take the quadratic integer ring $\mathbb{Z}[(1 + \sqrt{19})/2]$ is not a Euclidean Domain but is a P.I.D

**Proposition 1:** Let $R$ be a P.I.D and let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero elements of $R$. Let $d$ be a generator of the principal ideal generated by $a$ and $b$. Then 
1. $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$
2. $d$ can be written as an $R$-*linear combination* of $a$ and $b$, i.e., these are elements $x, y \in R$ with $$d = ax + by$$
3. $d$ is unique up to multiplication by a unit in $R$

**Proposition 2:** Every nonzero prime ideal in a P.I.D is a maximal ideal

Proof: Let $(p)$ be a nonzero prime ideal in a P.I.D $R$ and let $I = (m)$ be any ideal containing $(p)$. 

Now $p \in (m)$, so $p = rm$ for some $r \in R$. Since $(p)$ is a prime ideal and $rm \in (p)$, either $r$ or $m$ are in $(p)$. If $m \in (p)$, then $(p) = (m) = I$$, else $r = ps$. In this case $p = rm = psm$, so $sm = 1$, so $m$ is a unit as $R$ is integral, so $I = R$.
