## Module Definition

Let $R$ be a ring. An $R$-module is a set $M$ together with:
1. A binary operation $+$ on $M$ such that $M$ is an abelian group
2. An action of $R$ on $M$ denoted by $rm$ which satisfies
	1. $(r +s)m = rm + sm$, for all $r, s \in R$, $m \in M$
	2. (rs)m = r(sm), for all $r, s \in R$, $m \in M$
	3. $r(m + n) = rm + rn$, for all $r, s \in R$, $m \in M$

If the ring is unital, we add that $1m = m$, for all $m \in M$

We denote $M$ as a left or right module if the action of $R$ on $M$ is a left or right action only respectively.
