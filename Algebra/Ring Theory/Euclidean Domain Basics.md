## Ring Norm

Given an integral domain $R$, we can define a function $N : R \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{+} \cup \{0\}$ with $N(0) = 0$ called a norm. If $N(r) > 0$, for all $r \neq 0$, we call N a positive norm.

Note there can be multiple norms for a given integral domain R.

## Euclidean Domain Definition

An integral domain $R$ is called an euclidean domain if there is a norm $N$ such that for any two element $a, b \in R$ with $b \neq 0$, then there exists elements $q,r \in R$ such with $$a = qb + r \text{ with r = 0 or } N(r) < N(b)$$
$q$ here is called the quotient and $r$ the remainder of the division
