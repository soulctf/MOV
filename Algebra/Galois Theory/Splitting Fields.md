Let $f$ be a polynomial with coefficients in $F$. A [[Fields|field]] $E$ containing $F$ is said to **split** $f$ if $f$ splits in $E[X]$, i.e., $$f(x) = a \prod_{i=1}^{m}(X-\alpha_{i}) \quad a \in F, \alpha_{i}\in E$$ If $E$ splits $f$, and is generated by the roots of $f$, then it is called a **splitting** or **root field** for $f$.

**Proposition 1:** Let $F(\alpha)$ be a simple extension of $F$ and $\Omega$ a second extension of $F$
1. Suppose $\alpha$ is transcendental over $F$. For every $F$-homomoprhism $\phi : F(\alpha) \rightarrow \Omega$, $\phi(\alpha)$ is transcendental over $F$ and the map $\phi \mapsto \phi(\alpha)$ defines a one-to-one correspondence.
2. Suppose $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$, and let $f(X)$ be its minimal polynomial. For every $F$-homomorphism, $\phi : F[\alpha] \rightarrow \Omega, \phi(\alpha)$ is a root of $f(X)$ in $\Omega$, and the map $\phi \mapsto \phi(\alpha)$ defines a one-to-one correspondence. The number of such maps is the number of distinct roots of $f$ in $\Omega$
  
**Proposition 2:** Every polynomial $f \in F[X]$ has a splitting field $E_f$, and $$|E_{f}: F| \leq (deg \ f)!$$
Proof: Let $F_{1}= F[\alpha_1]$ be a stem field for some monic irreducible factor of $f$ in $F[X]$. Then $f(\alpha_{1)}= 0$, and we let $F_{2}= F_1[\alpha_2]$ be a stem field for some monic irreducible factor of $f(X)/(X-\alpha_1)$ in $F_1[X]$. Continuing in this fashion, we arrive at a splitting field, $E_f$. Let $n= \text{ deg } f$. Then $|F_{1} : F|$ = deg $g_{1} \leq n$, $|F_2:F_{1}|\leq n-1, ...,$ and so $|E_{f}: F| \leq n!$
